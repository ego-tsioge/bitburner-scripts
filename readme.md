# egos Bitburner progress

Welcome to my playground with Bitburner scripts. They are written in the game's own language Netscript, which is a subset of Javascript. 

If you want to play the game yourself - click on one of the following links.
[Bitburner (Github)](https://danielyxie.github.io/bitburner/) 
[Bitburner (Steam)](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1812820/Bitburner/)

What you see here is mostly copied from others

## Requirements

My script should be able to run with the 8 GB of RAM you have at game start. ** At least it does now that I'm writing this :) **

## Instalation

1. Load the script named `git-init.js` from GitHub by executing the following line in the Bitburner terminal:

`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ego-tsioge/bitburner-scripts/main/git-init.js git-init.js`

2. Start th script with `run git-init.js` 

This script automatically loads this repro onto the home server.
